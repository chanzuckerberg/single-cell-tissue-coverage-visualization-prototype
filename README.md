# Tissue coverage visualization prototype
This repository contains a D3 visualization tool that displays the number of cells from each tissue that are included in datasets hosted on the cellxgene data portal. It helps us compare what tissues we do have a lot of cell data for and what tissues we have very little cell data for within the portal.
